  <div class="hover-layer-text">
    In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol of the Buddha’s awakening and a reminder that all beings have the same potential to attain enlightenment. The lotus grows out of mud and rises to the water’s surface to bloom in beauty and purity, so too can the human develop the virtues of a Buddha and rise above desire and attachment to reveal the true nature.

    The stage of the lotus flower represents the stages on the spiritual path. For example, a closed bud is synonymous with the beginning of the journey. A partly open flower indicates walking the path. A fully blooming flower signifies the end of the journey--enlightenment.

Two halves that together complete wholeness. Yin and yang are also the starting point for change. When something is whole, by definition, it’s unchanging and complete. So when you split something into two halves – yin/yang, it upsets the equilibrium of wholeness. Both halves are chasing after each other as they seek a new balance with each other.

      <img src="swastika.png" width="400" height="300"  />

  <div class="hover-layer-text3">
    The ancient swastika is one of the oldest symbols on Earth. It is a symbol of peace, good luck, and positivity, predating the Indus Valley Civilization and is found in the art of many cultures: Egyptians, Romans, Celts, Greeks and Native Americans. It is also used in Vedic mathematics. The Sanskrit translation means "to be good," or “being with higher self.”

    In Buddhism, the swastika symbolizes the seal of the Buddha’s heart and contains within it the entire mind of the Buddha. It can be seen imprinted on the body, palms, chest, or feet of Buddha images. In China, the swastika represents the number ten thousand (wan), meaning infinity and auspiciousness.
